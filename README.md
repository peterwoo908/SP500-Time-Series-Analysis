# SP500-Time-Series-Analysis
In this project, I analyzed and created visualizations of the S&P500 share price over the last 10 years. Additionally, I used ARIMA forecasting models to predict future share price with a 95% confidence interval. Through a grid search I was able to obtain the optimal parameters of lagged Auto-Regression (p), differencing between observations (d), and movign averages (q).
